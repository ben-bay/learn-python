## Learning

Literally everyone writes code tutorials online. Here are some good ones:

  * https://www.learnpython.org/
  * https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics
  * https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/
  * https://www.udemy.com/course/python-core-and-advanced/
  * https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-paper-scissors-python/

...and on and on for eternity.

When u want to learn some programming thing, the steps are:

1. Figure out what thing you want to learn
2. Figure out how to describe the thing in words
3. Google it
4. Try it

## Quest
U r making an RPG. U need 24 points. Each * is 1 point.

## Required

### Technical

* Use python3
* Use strings, ints, and floats
* Use variables
* Use conditions
* Use lists
* Use for/while loops
* Use functions
* Use classes and objects

### Game elements

* Character attributes like hp, strength, xp
* Ability for character to choose between actions
* 6+ monsters
* 6+ items
* Include randomness
* Win and loss conditions (not too easy!)
* Someone named "Blecks"

## A la carte

### Technical

* Use dictionaries or tuples
* Use f-strings
* Use inheritance at least twice
* Separate your one file into multiple files by using modules
* Use exception handling
* Use the modulus operator (%) meaningfully
* Read/write to files
* Use the internet somehow, like an API
* Use recursion! (DANGER)
* Use version control (GitHub!)

### Game elements

* Interesting lore that somehow is connected to the gameplay.
* A special monster that tells riddles.
* Procedurally generated game elements (monsters, names, items, dungeons, etc.).
  This can count more than once for each time it's done in a different way.
* Add spells and magic
* Use dungeon maps-- some sort of class or data structure that represents levels/location
* Add more complex player attributes that affect the game in different ways such as wisdom, luck, charisma, etc.
* Let monsters / NPCs use items just like you.
* Add complexity to monsters / NPCs: individuals differing from their race, memory, likes/dislikes
* Add background music/sound (probably with a third party library). Bonus if it's dynamic, linked to what's happening in the game.
* Add visuals somehow
* Use WASD controls for player
* Custom goal -- as long as it's approved by Benj
