# learn-python
Welcome to Benj's excellent python quest. We r gonna learn us some python basics and make a fun game!

Literaly everyone writes code tutorials online. Here are some good ones:

  * https://www.learnpython.org/
  * https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics
  * https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/
  * https://www.udemy.com/course/python-core-and-advanced/
  * https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-paper-scissors-python/

...and on and on for eternity.

When u want to learn some programming thing, the steps are:

1. Figure out what thing you want to learn
2. Figure out how to describe the thing in words
3. Google it
4. Try it

U r making an RPG. U need 23 points. Each * is 1 point.

Technical
~~~~~~~~~
* Use strings, ints, and floats
* Use variables
* Use conditions
* Use lists
* Use for/while loops
* Use functions
* Use classes

Game elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Character attributes like hp, strength, speed
* Ability for character to choose between actions
* 6+ monsters
* 6+ items
* 
* Someone named "Blecks"

A la carte
~~~~~~~~~~
* Use dictionies or tuples
* Use f-strings
* Use the internet somehow, like an API
* Use inheritance at least twice

* Interesting lore that somehow is connected to the gameplay.
* Procedurally generated game elements (monsters, names, items, dungeons, etc.).
  This can count more than once for each time it's done in a different way.
* Add spells and magic
* Use dungeon maps-- some sort of class or data structure that represents levels/location
* Add complexity to monsters / NPCs: individuals differing from their race, memory, likes/dislikes
* Add background music (probably with a third party library)
* Add visuals somehow

* Custom goal -- as long as it's approved by Benj
